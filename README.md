# Overview

Space Hog Hunter is a tool I built to help track down those massive files and folders that eat up disk space. I wanted to get hands-on with Rust and see what it’s like to work with its unique approach to memory safety and error handling, so I figured a disk space analyzer would be a fun way to learn.

While building this, I learned a lot about how Rust handles file operations, directory traversal, and how its strict rules actually help you write safer code. The project gave me a chance to experiment with Rust’s ownership model, pattern matching, and its ecosystem of crates.

My main goal was to get comfortable with Rust by making something useful, and to share what I picked up along the way. If you’re curious about how it works or want to see the code in action, check out my demo video below.

# Development Environment

I coded this in Visual Studio Code, and I the extension rust-analyzer.

I did need to make sure I had cargo installed as well.

# Future Work

- Make it so that it can delete files
- Add functionality to be a bit more dynamic in terms of finding game directories
